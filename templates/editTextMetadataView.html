		<h3>Structure Editing</h3>
		<p>This page allows you to create text structure, it also allows
			you to add other users who can then modify structure and indexing
			information themselves. Text structure consists of markers at
			locations within the text which may consist of either or both of an
			index point (used to create the navigation index for this text) and a
			(potentially partial) piece of bibliographic information.</p>
		<p>In addition any marker can be flagged as discoverable - if so
			the marker is used to generate a bibliographic reference which is
			discoverable from the 'all texts' view. Without at least one such
			marker there is no way for users to find or access your text.</p>

		<p>By default when you upload a text you are the only user with
			access to this page. You can grant other users access by entering
			their user ID (their email address used to identify them within this
			textus instance) into the box below. You can also remove users from
			this list or resign your own membership providing you leave at least
			one user with access - this is to avoid orphan texts being left in
			the system. Note that a user you grant access can potentially remove
			you from the text in turn and select your collaborators accordingly!</p>
